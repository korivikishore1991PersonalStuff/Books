## Quality of Ideal wife and husband  
   
###   Qualities of a Ideal Wife
```Poem
Karyeshu dasi, Karaneshu manthri;
Bhojeshu mata, Shayaneshu rambha;
Kshamayeshu dharithri, Roopeshu lakshmi;
Satkarma yukta, Kuladharma pathni.
కార్యేషు దాసి, కరణేషు మంత్రి;
భోజేషు మాట, శయనేషు రంభ;
క్షమాయేషు ధరిత్రి, రూపేషు లక్ష్మి;
సత్కర్మ యుక్త, కులధర్మ పత్ని.
```
  
Karyeshu dasi means not exactly one who works like maid.But what is the main quality we look in maid is LOYALITY.  
  
Karaneshu Mantri means one who advises during the critical times, if you look at history, Chanakya played such an important role in Chadragupta’s life. The quality we are looking here is INTELLIGENCE.  
  
Bhojyeshu Mata, while feeding food who thinks like mom. A hotel owner or a chat wala (street food seller) will not give you food unless you pay money but a mother no matter what time it is if you tell her that you are hungry she cooks and feeds food to your hearts content.The quality we are looking here is UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.  
  
Shayaneshu Rambha: in hindu mythology Rambha , who is an apsara, is pictured as a very beautiful dancer damsel in indra’s (king of god’s) court. Rambha is known for her beauty and she pleases gods with her talent. The quality we are looking is who tries to cheer up, ENCOURAGE & GIVE COMFORT (even on bed).  
  
Kshamayeshu dharithri. While forgiving one should be like mother earth. Quality here is boundless COMPASSION.  
  
Roopeshu lakshmi. Goddess lakshmi is godess of wealth. Dispite her riches she is dedicated when Sri mahavishnu, her consort, took incarnation as srirama, she followed with him during vanavasa(exile) instead of sitting in vaikunta(luxury). Here the quality we see is the DEDICATION and HUMILITY.   
  
Shat dharma yuktah: woman who has this six virtues  
  
Kula dharma Patni : a virteous good housewife (a married woman who is not employed outside the home)  
    
###   Qualities of a Ideal Husband  
```Poem
Bhogeshu Raja, Vachaneshu Rama;
Chaturasya Krishna, Dhairyeshu Karna;
Roopecha Indra, Kaameshu Madana;
Shatdharmayuktha, manadharma Ramana.
భోగేషు రాజా, వచనేషు రామ;
చతురస్య కృష్ణ, ధైర్యేషు కర్ణ;
రూపేచ ఇంద్ర, కామేషు మదన;
షట్ధర్మయుక్త, మనుధర్మ రమణ.
```
  
Bhogeshu Raja: Rich like a king.  
  
Vachaneshu Rama: Honest like Lord Rama.  
  
Chaturasya Krishna: Intellectually smart like Lord Krishna.  
  
Dhairyeshu Karna: Courageous like Karna.

If you are a man, do you think you can qualify as a perfect husband possessing these six qualities?

 ## Surviving Autocracy  
 ```
gunam leni vadu kulam godugu padatadu; 
manavatham leni vadu matham musugu vesthadu; 
pasa leni vadu prantham vusu yethuthadu; 
janulu antha oke kutumbam; 
jagamantha oke nelayam
Rule #1: Believe the autocrat. He means what he says. Whenever you find yourself thinking, or hear others claiming, that he is exaggerating, that is our innate tendency to reach for a rationalization. This will happen often: humans seem to have evolved to practice denial when confronted publicly with the unacceptable. Back in the 1930s, The New York Times assured its readers that Hitler’s anti-Semitism was all posture. More recently, the same newspaper made a telling choice between two statements made by Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov following a police crackdown on protesters in Moscow: “The police acted mildly—I would have liked them to act more harshly” rather than those protesters’ “liver should have been spread all over the pavement.” Perhaps the journalists could not believe their ears. But they should—both in the Russian case, and in the American one. For all the admiration Trump has expressed for Putin, the two men are very different; if anything, there is even more reason to listen to everything Trump has said. He has no political establishment into which to fold himself following the campaign, and therefore no reason to shed his campaign rhetoric. On the contrary: it is now the establishment that is rushing to accommodate him—from the president, who met with him at the White House on Thursday, to the leaders of the Republican Party, who are discarding their long-held scruples to embrace his radical positions.

He has received the support he needed to win, and the adulation he craves, precisely because of his outrageous threats. Trump rally crowds have chanted “Lock her up!” They, and he, meant every word. If Trump does not go after Hillary Clinton on his first day in office, if he instead focuses, as his acceptance speech indicated he might, on the unifying project of investing in infrastructure (which, not coincidentally, would provide an instant opportunity to reward his cronies and himself), it will be foolish to breathe a sigh of relief. Trump has made his plans clear, and he has made a compact with his voters to carry them out. These plans include not only dismantling legislation such as Obamacare but also doing away with judicial restraint—and, yes, punishing opponents.

To begin jailing his political opponents, or just one opponent, Trump will begin by trying to capture members of the judicial system. Observers and even activists functioning in the normal-election mode are fixated on the Supreme Court as the site of the highest-risk impending Trump appointment. There is little doubt that Trump will appoint someone who will cause the Court to veer to the right; there is also the risk that it might be someone who will wreak havoc with the very culture of the high court. And since Trump plans to use the judicial system to carry out his political vendettas, his pick for attorney general will be no less important. Imagine former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie going after Hillary Clinton on orders from President Trump; quite aside from their approach to issues such as the Geneva Conventions, the use of police powers, criminal justice reforms, and other urgent concerns.

Rule #2: Do not be taken in by small signs of normality. Consider the financial markets this week, which, having tanked overnight, rebounded following the Clinton and Obama speeches. Confronted with political volatility, the markets become suckers for calming rhetoric from authority figures. So do people. Panic can be neutralized by falsely reassuring words about how the world as we know it has not ended. It is a fact that the world did not end on November 8 nor at any previous time in history. Yet history has seen many catastrophes, and most of them unfolded over time. That time included periods of relative calm. One of my favorite thinkers, the Jewish historian Simon Dubnow, breathed a sigh of relief in early October 1939: he had moved from Berlin to Latvia, and he wrote to his friends that he was certain that the tiny country wedged between two tyrannies would retain its sovereignty and Dubnow himself would be safe. Shortly after that, Latvia was occupied by the Soviets, then by the Germans, then by the Soviets again—but by that time Dubnow had been killed. Dubnow was well aware that he was living through a catastrophic period in history—it’s just that he thought he had managed to find a pocket of normality within it.

Rule #3: Institutions will not save you. It took Putin a year to take over the Russian media and four years to dismantle its electoral system; the judiciary collapsed unnoticed. The capture of institutions in Turkey has been carried out even faster, by a man once celebrated as the democrat to lead Turkey into the EU. Poland has in less than a year undone half of a quarter century’s accomplishments in building a constitutional democracy.

Of course, the United States has much stronger institutions than Germany did in the 1930s, or Russia does today. Both Clinton and Obama in their speeches stressed the importance and strength of these institutions. The problem, however, is that many of these institutions are enshrined in political culture rather than in law, and all of them—including the ones enshrined in law—depend on the good faith of all actors to fulfill their purpose and uphold the Constitution.

The national press is likely to be among the first institutional victims of Trumpism. There is no law that requires the presidential administration to hold daily briefings, none that guarantees media access to the White House. Many journalists may soon face a dilemma long familiar to those of us who have worked under autocracies: fall in line or forfeit access. There is no good solution (even if there is a right answer), for journalism is difficult and sometimes impossible without access to information.

The power of the investigative press—whose adherence to fact has already been severely challenged by the conspiracy-minded, lie-spinning Trump campaign—will grow weaker. The world will grow murkier. Even in the unlikely event that some mainstream media outlets decide to declare themselves in opposition to the current government, or even simply to report its abuses and failings, the president will get to frame many issues. Coverage, and thinking, will drift in a Trumpian direction, just as it did during the campaign—when, for example, the candidates argued, in essence, whether Muslim Americans bear collective responsibility for acts of terrorism or can redeem themselves by becoming the “eyes and ears” of law enforcement. Thus was xenophobia further normalized, paving the way for Trump to make good on his promises to track American Muslims and ban Muslims from entering the United States.

Rule #4: Be outraged. If you follow Rule #1 and believe what the autocrat-elect is saying, you will not be surprised. But in the face of the impulse to normalize, it is essential to maintain one’s capacity for shock. This will lead people to call you unreasonable and hysterical, and to accuse you of overreacting. It is no fun to be the only hysterical person in the room. Prepare yourself.

Despite losing the popular vote, Trump has secured as much power as any American leader in recent history. The Republican Party controls both houses of Congress. There is a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The country is at war abroad and has been in a state of mobilization for fifteen years. This means not only that Trump will be able to move fast but also that he will become accustomed to an unusually high level of political support. He will want to maintain and increase it—his ideal is the totalitarian-level popularity numbers of Vladimir Putin—and the way to achieve that is through mobilization. There will be more wars, abroad and at home.

Rule #5: Don’t make compromises. Like Ted Cruz, who made the journey from calling Trump “utterly amoral” and a “pathological liar” to endorsing him in late September to praising his win as an “amazing victory for the American worker,” Republican politicians have fallen into line. Conservative pundits who broke ranks during the campaign will return to the fold. Democrats in Congress will begin to make the case for cooperation, for the sake of getting anything done—or at least, they will say, minimizing the damage. Nongovernmental organizations, many of which are reeling at the moment, faced with a transition period in which there is no opening for their input, will grasp at chances to work with the new administration. This will be fruitless—damage cannot be minimized, much less reversed, when mobilization is the goal—but worse, it will be soul-destroying. In an autocracy, politics as the art of the possible is in fact utterly amoral. Those who argue for cooperation will make the case, much as President Obama did in his speech, that cooperation is essential for the future. They will be willfully ignoring the corrupting touch of autocracy, from which the future must be protected.

Rule #6: Remember the future. Nothing lasts forever. Donald Trump certainly will not, and Trumpism, to the extent that it is centered on Trump’s persona, will not either. Failure to imagine the future may have lost the Democrats this election. They offered no vision of the future to counterbalance Trump’s all-too-familiar white-populist vision of an imaginary past. They had also long ignored the strange and outdated institutions of American democracy that call out for reform—like the electoral college, which has now cost the Democratic Party two elections in which Republicans won with the minority of the popular vote. That should not be normal. But resistance—stubborn, uncompromising, outraged—should be.

పాత  కథ కాదు, కోడి కాదు కదా కోడి యికను కూడా పీకలేక పొయ్యాడు 
గాలి లో కత్తులు తిప్పటం, అబ్బో బ్రమ్మాండం అన్ని అనిపించటం
విశ్వాససం లేని కుక్క, తెలివి లేని చిత్తకాసిన నక్క,
మంచానికి పనికి రాణి చెక్క, నీతి లేని లుచ్చా 
ఒక్క కంట కన్నీరు. మర్రు కంట పన్నీరు. ఒక కంట కాటుక మర్రు కాంత కర్రం
అన్నదాత కడుపు తంతే కుడు దొరకదు అంతే. కన్నా భూమి కాళ్ళ తంతే నిలువ నీడ దొరకదు అంతే 
గుణం లేని వాడు కులం గొడుగు పడతాడు 
మానవత్వం లేనివాడు మతం ముసుగు పడతాడు 
పస లేని వాడు ప్రాంతం ఊసు ఎత్తుతాడు 
జగమంతా ఒక నిలయం జనమంతా ఒక కుటుంబం
```
