###   Qualities of a Ideal Wife
```Poem
Karyeshu dasi, Karaneshu manthri;
Bhojeshu mata, Shayaneshu rambha;
Kshamayeshu dharithri, Roopeshu lakshmi;
Satkarma yukta, Kuladharma pathni.
కార్యేషు దాసి, కరణేషు మంత్రి;
భోజేషు మాట, శయనేషు రంభ;
క్షమాయేషు ధరిత్రి, రూపేషు లక్ష్మి;
సత్కర్మ యుక్త, కులధర్మ పత్ని.
```
  
Karyeshu dasi means not exactly one who works like maid.But what is the main quality we look in maid is LOYALITY.  
  
Karaneshu Mantri means one who advises during the critical times, if you look at history, Chanakya played such an important role in Chadragupta’s life. The quality we are looking here is INTELLIGENCE.  
  
Bhojyeshu Mata, while feeding food who thinks like mom. A hotel owner or a chat wala (street food seller) will not give you food unless you pay money but a mother no matter what time it is if you tell her that you are hungry she cooks and feeds food to your hearts content.The quality we are looking here is UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.  
  
Shayaneshu Rambha: in hindu mythology Rambha , who is an apsara, is pictured as a very beautiful dancer damsel in indra’s (king of god’s) court. Rambha is known for her beauty and she pleases gods with her talent. The quality we are looking is who tries to cheer up, ENCOURAGE & GIVE COMFORT (even on bed).  
  
Kshamayeshu dharithri. While forgiving one should be like mother earth. Quality here is boundless COMPASSION.  
  
Roopeshu lakshmi. Goddess lakshmi is godess of wealth. Dispite her riches she is dedicated when Sri mahavishnu, her consort, took incarnation as srirama, she followed with him during vanavasa(exile) instead of sitting in vaikunta(luxury). Here the quality we see is the DEDICATION and HUMILITY.   
  
Shat dharma yuktah: woman who has this six virtues  
  
Kula dharma Patni : a virteous good housewife (a married woman who is not employed outside the home)  
    
###   Qualities of a Ideal Husband  
```Poem
Bhogeshu Raja, Vachaneshu Rama;
Chaturasya Krishna, Dhairyeshu Karna;
Roopecha Indra, Kaameshu Madana;
Shatdharmayuktha, manadharma Ramana.
భోగేషు రాజా, వచనేషు రామ;
చతురస్య కృష్ణ, ధైర్యేషు కర్ణ;
రూపేచ ఇంద్ర, కామేషు మదన;
షట్ధర్మయుక్త, మనుధర్మ రమణ.
```
  
Bhogeshu Raja: Rich like a king.  
  
Vachaneshu Rama: Honest like Lord Rama.  
  
Chaturasya Krishna: Intellectually smart like Lord Krishna.  
  
Dhairyeshu Karna: Courageous like Karna.

If you are a man, do you think you can qualify as a perfect husband possessing these six qualities?

## Few words against the greed of Dollors  
```Poem
टूने पैसा बहुत कमाया, इस पैसे ने देश छुदाया
पन्छी पिन्जरा तोद के आज, देश परय छोद के आज
आज उमर बहुत है छोति, अप्ने घर मेइन भि हैन रोती 

Toone paisaa bahut kamaayaa, is paise ne desh chhudaayaa
Panchhi pinjaraa tod ke aaja, desh paraya chhod ke aaja
Aaja umar bahut hai chhoti, apne ghar mein bhi hain roti
```

```Poem
सम समय बालवान, नहीं मनुशी बालवान,

Kabe Arjun lootiyo, wahi dhanoosh wahi baan.
